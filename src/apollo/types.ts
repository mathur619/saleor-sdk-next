/**
 * __useOrdersByUserQuery__
 *
 * To run a query within a React component, call `useOrdersByUserQuery` and pass it any options that fit your needs.
 * When your component renders, `useOrdersByUserQuery` returns an object from Apollo Client that contains loading, error, and data properties
 * you can use to render your UI.
 *
 * @param baseOptions options that will be passed into the query, supported options are listed on: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/#options;
 *
 * @example
 * const { data, loading, error } = useOrdersByUserQuery({
 *   variables: {
 *      perPage: // value for 'perPage'
 *      after: // value for 'after'
 *   },
 * });
